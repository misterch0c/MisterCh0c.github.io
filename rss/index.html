If you never heard of Ghost well.. You're looking at it. It's a minimalistic CMS and I really like it so far. <br>
Buster is a static page generator built for Ghost. We need it since you can only host static pages on Github. <br>
So let's get started. We'll first download/install all the things we'll need:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://nodejs.org/dist/">Install Nodejs</a> (version 0.10.x!)<br></li>
<li><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-279/">Install Python 2.7</a><br></li>
<li><a href="https://ghost.org/download/">Get Ghost</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We need pip to install Buster. Luckily for us Python 2.7 comes with easy install. So open up your terminal and run the following</p>

<pre><code><span class="nocode">cd "c:\Python27\Scripts"
easy_install.exe install pip
</span></code></pre>

<p>Now you should be able to</p>

<pre><span class="nocode">pip.exe install buster</span></pre>

<p>Note that pip is located to the C:\Python27\Scripts folder. <br>
At this point you should be able to run the'Node' and 'python' command, if Windows doesn't find it follow the next step. <br>
It seems like Nodejs installer appends a trailing '/' in the Windows PATH variable and that cause it to fail. So open up control panel -> System -> Advanced Parameters -> Environments Variable then look for the Path variable and click edit. <br>
You should have this included in your PATH:</p>

<pre><span class="nocode">C:\Program Files (x86)\nodejs;C:\Python27</span></pre>

<h1>Install Ghost </h1>  

<p>Let's get into the good stuff! Extract Ghost in the folder of your choice. <br>
Get in there and run  </p>

<pre><span class="nocode">npm install --production
npm start
</span></pre>

<p>You can now access your blog locally on localhost:2368 and  localhost:2368/ghost to quickly configurate it. Now that we have Ghost installed locally it's time to generate a static page and push it on Github. <br>
So firstly go on Github and create a new repository nammed yourUsername.github.io <br>
Get in the directory where you installed Buster and run the following command. </p>

<h1>Generate static pages</h1>  

<pre><span class="nocode">buster.exe setup
buster.exe generate --domain 127.0.0.1:2368
buster.exe preview
buster.exe deploy</span></pre>

<p>The setup command will ask you for your Github repository url. <br>
The generate command simply generates static pages for you. Then the preview command will show you a preview of the generated pages and the deploy command will push everything on Github. <br>
If you're using Cygwin forget about it it won't work. Also I got an issue with the buster executable but it also comes with a python script so use that instead if you have issues.</p>

<p>On random notes for this blog I forked a theme called "The Shell", link to the orignal one is on the footer or you can check <a href="https://github.com/misterch0c/The-Shell">my fork on github</a></p>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/ghost-buster-hosted-on-github-page-windows-installation/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">b4472bc4-a583-4929-ba1b-6499d84c06b4</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Mister Choc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2015 11:42:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[[GITS-CTF2015] Aart - web writeup]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>[This is a repost from my old dead blog, it was originaly posted on january 18th 2015]</p>

<p>The <a href="https://2015.ghostintheshellcode.com/">Ghost in the Shellcode CTF</a> is now over but the website is still up and you can still complete challenges if you like (update: well not anymore..) <br>  
This is my little write up and the web challenge called "Aart". Here's how it looks when you go to the server for the first time <br>  
<br> <br>  
<img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2015/02/aart.PNG" alt="">
<br> <br>  
On the register page there was a "Source code" link so I downloaded the code and took a look at it. I noticed 2 interesting things <br>  
Firstly the 2 SQL requests that are made when a user register <br>  
<br> <br>  
<img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2015/02/sqlaart.PNG" alt="">
<br> <br>  
Then in this portion of code you can actually see that if isRestricted is true then your account is restricted and otherwise you can get the key.</p>

<p><br> <br>  
<img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2015/02/iddd.PNG" alt="">
<br> <br>  
If you still didn't get it we're just going to register/login a bunch of usernames and wait for the key (: <br>  
It's a timing thing. At some point the first INSERT TO will be called twice before the second one has even been called once. This will give us a user with no restricted flag. <br>  
<br>  </p>

<pre>
for i in {1..50};
do     
curl --data "username=i$i&password=i" http://aart.2015.ghostintheshellcode.com/register.php -s >&1 >/dev/null &     
curl --data "username=i$i&password=i" http://aart.2015.ghostintheshellcode.com/login.php;
done</pre>

<p><br> <br>  
So this script is going to create accounts from 'i1' to 'i50' with the password 'i'. At some point we stumble on an unrestricted account <br>  
<br> <br>  
<img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2015/02/success.PNG" alt="">
<br> <br>  
Here we go. "this is a key" was actually the key here (;</p>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/untitled/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">a91ae5a7-5ef4-4f5f-9869-ad78fc50a36b</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Mister Choc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2015 15:57:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Defuse the tar bomb]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Just some shell script that could have saved the world (: <br> <br>

Hello world! Finally I decided to make a blog (: I did it before, it only had a few post and was located at misterch0c.ghost.io but since after 15 days ghost.io asked me to pay 10$/months I just moved here. I really enjoy <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> and will probably make a blog post on how I set it up using github pages quickly. In the meantime I'll just reposte the 2-3 articles my blog had before. I'm MisterCh0c, I like cheap m&amp;m's, infosec and developing. Feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/MisterCh0c">follow me on twitter</a>. Cya later.</p>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/hello-world/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">4791e5a2-2752-42eb-be6b-2d0c453f4a3c</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Mister Choc]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2015 13:22:03 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
